### What is NodeJS?
Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Google Chrome. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it possible to run JavaScript on the server. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient and lightweight, suitable for real-time applications. It also comes with a rich set of libraries and modules, making it easier to build scalable network applications.

### What are REST APIs?
REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are a set of architectural principles for designing networked applications. It is an approach used to build web services that follow a stateless client-server model. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. These resources are identified by URLs. REST APIs are widely used to enable communication between different systems over the internet and are the standard for building web services.

### What are middlewares?
In the context of web development, middleware refers to software components or functions that sit between the client and the server in the request-response cycle. They play a crucial role in handling and modifying HTTP requests and responses. Middleware can be used to perform tasks such as authentication, logging, compression, and error handling. It helps in keeping the core logic of the application clean and modular by separating cross-cutting concerns into reusable middleware functions.

### How does a website work internally?
A website works internally through a series of steps involving the client (usually a web browser) and the server (where the website is hosted). Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Client Sends Request:** When a user enters a URL or clicks on a link, the web browser sends an HTTP request to the server.

2. **Server Processes the Request:** The web server receives the request and processes it. It might fetch data from a database or perform other tasks based on the request.

3. **Server Sends Response:** The server sends an HTTP response back to the client containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to render the web page.

4. **Client Renders the Page:** The web browser receives the response and renders the web page, interpreting the HTML, applying styles from CSS, and executing JavaScript code.

5. **Client Interacts with the Page:** The user interacts with the web page, and if necessary, the client may send additional requests to the server (e.g., for submitting a form or fetching more data).

6. **Repeat Steps 2-5 (if needed):** The process repeats for each new request made by the user while navigating the website.

### What is MongoDB? Why use it instead of MySQL?
MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database management system that uses a document-oriented data model. Instead of using traditional tables and rows like relational databases (e.g., MySQL), MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making it more flexible and scalable for certain types of applications.

Reasons to use MongoDB over MySQL:

1. **Schema Flexibility:** MongoDB's flexible schema allows developers to store different types of data in the same collection without the need for a predefined schema.

2. **Horizontal Scalability:** MongoDB can easily scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers, making it suitable for handling large-scale applications and big data.

3. **Speed:** MongoDB's document-based storage and indexing mechanisms can result in faster read and write operations compared to traditional relational databases.

4. **No Joins:** MongoDB's denormalized data model eliminates the need for complex joins, simplifying queries and improving performance.

5. **Ease of Development:** For applications with evolving requirements, MongoDB's schema-less nature makes it easier to adapt to changes during development.

### Which type of MongoDB database to prefer and why?
In MongoDB, there are mainly two types of databases: 

1. **Single-Node Database (Standalone):** This type of database setup consists of a single MongoDB instance running on a single server. It is suitable for development, testing, or small-scale applications with low traffic and data volume. However, it lacks high availability and fault tolerance.

2. **Replica Set Database:** A replica set is a group of MongoDB instances that maintain copies of the same data. It provides high availability, automatic failover, and read scalability. In a replica set, one node acts as the primary server for write operations, while others act as secondary servers for read operations. If the primary node fails, one of the secondaries automatically becomes the new primary.

**Prefer Replica Set Database for Production:**
In a production environment, it is recommended to use a replica set due to its high availability and automatic failover capabilities. It ensures that your MongoDB deployment is resilient to server failures and provides data redundancy. Additionally, you can distribute read operations across multiple secondaries, improving the overall read scalability of your application.

### Advantages of REST:
RESTful APIs offer several advantages:

1. **Simplicity:** REST APIs use standard HTTP methods and follow a uniform structure, making them easy to understand and use.

2. **Scalability:** Due to their stateless nature, RESTful APIs can scale well by distributing requests across servers.

3. **Flexibility:** REST allows you to use different data formats, such as JSON and XML, for exchanging data between the client and server.

4. **Compatibility:** REST works over HTTP, which is supported by almost all platforms and devices, making it widely compatible.

5. **Caching:** REST APIs can leverage HTTP caching mechanisms, reducing server load and improving performance.

6. **Security:** RESTful APIs can use HTTPS for secure communication, and standard security practices like API keys and OAuth can be implemented.

### How to increase scalability?
To increase scalability in web applications, you can consider the following approaches:

1. **Load Balancing:** Implementing load balancing techniques distributes incoming requests across multiple servers, ensuring even distribution of traffic and preventing overload on a single server.

2. **Caching:** Use caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory. This reduces the load on the database and improves response times.

3. **Database Optimization:** Optimize database queries, use indexing, and denormalize data where appropriate to enhance database performance.

4. **Asynchronous Processing:** Offload time-consuming tasks to background processes or worker queues to ensure faster responses to user requests.

5. **Horizontal Scaling:** Scale horizontally by adding more servers to your infrastructure, allowing you to handle increased traffic and distribute the load.

6. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Use CDNs to cache and serve static assets closer to users, reducing server load and improving content delivery speed.

7. **Microservices Architecture:** Adopt a microservices architecture, which allows you to divide your application into smaller, independent services, making it easier to scale individual components as needed.

### How does a video go trending on YouTube?
YouTube's trending algorithm is complex and proprietary, but it considers various factors to determine which videos appear on the trending page. Some key factors that might influence a video's trendiness on YouTube include:

1. **View Count:** Videos that receive a large number of views in a short period are likely to trend.

2. **Engagement Metrics:** Videos with high watch time, likes, comments, and shares are more likely to trend.

3. **Velocity of Growth:** YouTube looks at how quickly a video is

 gaining views and engagement.

4. **Geography and Language:** Trending is often tailored to specific regions and languages.

5. **Freshness:** Newly published videos that gain traction quickly have a higher chance of trending.

6. **Content Type:** Certain types of content (e.g., music videos, major events) are more likely to trend.

YouTube's trending algorithm is continually evolving, and the platform may tweak it to ensure a diverse and relevant mix of videos on the trending page.

### How to display the top 1000 users who viewed your video?
To display the top 1000 users who viewed your video on YouTube, you would typically need access to the YouTube Analytics API or the YouTube Studio dashboard (for content creators). Here's a general outline of how you could achieve this:

1. **API Access:** Ensure you have the necessary API access credentials to interact with the YouTube Analytics API.

2. **Retrieve Video Data:** Use the API to fetch data for the specific video in question. You can obtain metrics like video views, watch time, and viewer demographics.

3. **Sort and Filter:** Sort the data based on the number of views in descending order to identify the top viewers. You can limit the results to the top 1000 users.

4. **Display Results:** Present the list of top viewers on your website or application, showing their usernames or IDs.

Please note that the exact implementation details and API calls will depend on the platform and tools you are using to access YouTube's analytics data.

### What is zk-SNARK?
zk-SNARK stands for "Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge." It is a cryptographic proof system that allows one party (the prover) to demonstrate to another party (the verifier) the knowledge of some information without revealing any details about that information, other than its validity.

In simpler terms, zk-SNARKs enable the verification of the truthfulness of a statement or computation without having to reveal the inputs or steps of the computation. This is achieved through advanced mathematical techniques like elliptic curve pairings and homomorphic encryption.

zk-SNARKs have gained significant attention in the field of blockchain and cryptocurrencies because they can be used to validate transactions privately and efficiently. By employing zk-SNARKs, blockchain networks can ensure data privacy while maintaining the ability to verify the integrity of transactions.

### What is DES and AES algorithms?
DES (Data Encryption Standard) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) are both symmetric-key block ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt data. Symmetric-key means they use the same secret key for both encryption and decryption processes.

**DES (Data Encryption Standard):**
- DES was developed in the 1970s and became a widely used encryption algorithm.
- It uses a 56-bit key and operates on 64-bit blocks of data.
- Over time, DES was found to have security vulnerabilities due to its short key length, and it is now considered relatively weak.

**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):**
- AES was introduced in the early 2000s to replace DES and provide stronger security.
- It supports key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits and operates on data blocks of 128 bits.
- AES has become the most widely used symmetric encryption algorithm and is considered highly secure.

### What are symmetric ciphers, explain with an example?
Symmetric ciphers are a type of encryption algorithms that use a single secret key for both encryption and decryption. The same key is used by both the sender and the receiver to protect the confidentiality of the data. The key must be kept secret and secure between the communicating parties.

Example of a symmetric cipher (using a simple substitution cipher):

**Caesar Cipher:**
The Caesar Cipher is a classic example of a symmetric encryption technique. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:
- Plain: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
- Cipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW

Using the key "3," the word "HELLO" would be encrypted as "EBIIL." To decrypt the ciphertext, the receiver uses the same key to shift the letters back to the original position.

Note that the Caesar Cipher is very weak and easily breakable because it has a limited key space (only 26 possible keys). Modern symmetric ciphers like AES and DES use much larger key spaces and more sophisticated algorithms to ensure security.

### What are block ciphers?
Block ciphers are a type of symmetric encryption algorithm that processes data in fixed-size blocks and transforms each block into a corresponding block of ciphertext using a secret key. Unlike stream ciphers that encrypt data one bit or byte at a time, block ciphers operate on fixed-length blocks (e.g., 64 or 128 bits) of plaintext.

The block cipher process consists of several rounds of encryption, where the plaintext block is subjected to various cryptographic operations (e.g., substitutions, permutations, and bitwise operations) along with the secret key to produce the ciphertext block.

For example, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used block cipher that processes data in blocks of 128 bits (16 bytes) and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

Block ciphers can be used to encrypt large amounts of data efficiently and securely, making them fundamental building blocks for various cryptographic applications, including disk encryption, secure communications, and secure authentication protocols.
